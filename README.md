## Description

This project serves as a learning exercise to transition from a RESTful API to GraphQL using Apollo Server. It aimed to explore GraphQL concepts, such as schema definition, queries, mutations, and subscriptions, while also implementing authentication functionalities. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of GraphQL and its integration with the Apollo Server, as well as to experiment with authentication mechanisms overall and really see how much they stand on their own and how they get used. 

## Deployment

Deployment of the application gave me quiet a few struggles when I first took a crack at it, however after working on beginning to deploy a few other apps I was able to see what I needed to adjust and now we have the fully deployed google book search recoded into graphql! Enjoy (:
